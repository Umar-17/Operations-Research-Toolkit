A modern, web-based toolkit for solving complex Operations Research and optimization problems. This project provides an interactive interface for modeling constraints, analyzing trade-offs, and visualizing step-by-step algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

The **OR Toolkit** includes solvers for the following methods:

-   **Simplex Method:** Solve Linear Programming problems with Big-M support and sensitivity analysis.
-   **Transportation Problem:** Optimize shipping routes using North-West Corner, Least Cost, and Vogel's Approximation (VAM) with MODI optimization.
-   **Hungarian Method:** Solve assignment problems to optimally assign resources/workers to tasks.
-   **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):** Find the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once.
-   **Shortest Route:** Calculate the minimum cost path using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
-   **Branch and Bound:** Solve Integer Linear Programming problems with visual tree exploration.
-   **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Maximize value under capacity constraints using Dynamic Programming.

## ✨ Key Highlights

-   **Interactive Visualizations:** See how algorithms behave step-by-step.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Dark/Light Mode:** Seamless theme switching with persistent preferences.
-   **No Installation Required:** Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript—runs directly in your browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Styling:** Custom CSS (Modern UI, Glassmorphism effects)
-   **Icons:** SVG Icons

## 📦 Installation & Usage

Since this is a static web application, no backend server or package installation is required.
